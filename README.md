# Overview

Game developement was always something that I thought I'd be into because I have been playing video games for most of my life. It was a lot harder than I thought it would be and it takes so much time. I used arcade through python which is a framework for building games. Using this framework made everything about making a game so much easier. I decided to do something really simple which is a fireman catching fire and putting it out. Which is really just a moving sprite colliding with another sprite and removing the fire.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used for this game were really simple, just the python arcade framework and simple python code.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I want to be able to make a standing platform that will disappear when it is hit too many times with the fireballs.
* Put in sounds for different collisions.
* Move the platforms back and forth.
* Apply gravity to the player.
